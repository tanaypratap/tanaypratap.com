            I have spent my entire life working as an engineer and moonlighting
            as a teacher. I resigned from my position as a Sr. Software Engineer
            at Microsoft because I believe education is still an unsolved
            problem, and I am now totally dedicated to ensuring that everyone
            can access education, not just the wealthy few. I&apos;m working on
            implementing the tried and testing model of closing the skill gap
            between technical and engineering roles into non-technical and
            business roles.

            I believe that your work should become your degree, and your craft
            should become your credentials. So, currently working on providing
            students with a curriculum of proof of work and industry-focused
            courses in an affordable and accessible manner through Invact. Want
            to know how? It&apos;s a long story, so follow me to learn more. I
            am telling it in parts every day.
